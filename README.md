# MapColoring
The program makes graph coloring with GUI using a minimum number of colors, with neighboring nodes in different colors.

First, the program receives an iteration count from the user. Then it gets nodes from the user with neighborhood relations (e.g. "a -> b"). 
After that, it tells the minimum number of colors according to the number of nodes and asks the user to choose colors. 
Finally, it creates the graph and colors the nodes one by one according to the number of iterations.
